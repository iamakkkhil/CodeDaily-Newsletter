## **Motivation**:
From the start of this year 2021, I am solving coding questions daily and seen a substansial improvement in my problem solving ability and coding skills. I strongly believe daily coding practice is must for the developers who are starting in this field. 

To practice this daily, the difficult task is to hunt for the question you are planning to solve for the day and to tackle this, I tried to find a service which can send me questions daily and came across **[dailycodingproblem.com](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)**. The problem however with this service was they only provided very tough interview questions which was really difficult for me to get into and to stay motivated to solve the next one .

So, I thought of creating a similar service, which can catered the beginners and would not scare them away. I also intended it to provide questions to the users based on their expertise. Since, this service would deliever questions in your inbox which reduces the hassle of finding questions daily.

## **Future Plans:**
1. Integration of webcrawlers to scrape questions from different websites and store it in a database.
2. Video solutions for the available questions.
3. Feedback for every question.
4. Dilevering questions according to the difficulty level so it can serve mass audience, right from beginners to experts who are willing to put their coding skills to test.
5. User profile system: 
    1. Portal to upload answers / or keep a track of the users github repo(In which they will uplaod their solutions) to measure their progress.
    2. A gloabal leaderboard.
    3. Discussion section for every question.

6. Upgrading from **#7DaysOfCode** to **#100DaysOfCode** or **#365DaysOfCode**.
7. Integrating **AI/ML** to send questions based on the ability/progress/level to solve the previous questions/ based on the past progress.
