## **🔥 Motivation**:
From the start of this year 2021, I am solving coding questions daily and seen a substansial improvement in my problem solving ability 💪 and coding skills 🐱‍💻. I strongly believe daily coding practice is must for the developers 👨‍💻 who are starting in this field. 

To practice this daily, the difficult task is to hunt 🔍 for the question ❓ you are planning to solve for the day and to tackle this, I tried to find a service which can send me questions daily and came across **[dailycodingproblem.com](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/)**. The problem however with this service was they only provided very tough interview questions 😫 which was really difficult for me to get into and to stay motivated to solve the next one.

So, I thought 💡 of creating a similar service, which can catered the beginners and would not scare them away 🏃. I also intended it to provide questions to the users based on their expertise. Since, this service would deliever questions in your inbox 📧 which reduces the hassle of finding questions daily.


## **🔮 Future Plans:**
1. Integration of webcrawlers to scrape questions from different websites and store it in a database 💾.
2. Video solutions 🙋 for the available questions ❓.
3. Feedback ⭐ for every question.
4. Dilevering questions according to the difficulty level 🐱‍💻 so it can serve mass audience, right from beginners to experts who are willing to put their coding skills to test.
5. User 👤 profile system: 
    1. Portal to upload answers / or keep a track of the users github repo(In which they will uplaod their solutions) to measure their progress 📊.
    2. A gloabal leaderboard 🌏🏅.
    3. Discussion section for every question.

6. Upgrading from **#7DaysOfCode** to **#100DaysOfCode** or **#365DaysOfCode** 🚀.
7. Integrating **AI/ML** 🤖 to send questions based on the ability/progress/level 💪 to solve the previous questions/ based on the past progress.
